### What I learned

I have learned how to work with Swiper and how to add a slider inside my landing page with minimum effort.

### Continued development

I definitely have to learn more about Sass. I need to work with mixins. Also I think I have to create some snippets with pieces of code, which I can use in my projects. It should save some time.
